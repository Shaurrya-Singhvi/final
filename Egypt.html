<p>Other than Pyramids, two other attractions of Cairo deserve special mention.Khan el-Khalili  bazaar is a major souk in the historic center of Cairo. Shops typically sell souvenirs, antiques and jewellery and sky is the limit for bargaining. But strolling along the narrow lane is a real immersive experience. In addition to shops, there are several coffeehouses ( serving arabic coffee and offering Sheesha), restaurants, and street food vendors distributed throughout the market. This particular joint offered us really good local vegetarian stuff. The al-Hussein Mosque is adjacent to Khan el-Khalili, and Al-Azhar University and its mosque are nearby.
The Museum of Egyptian Antiquities, known commonly as the Egyptian Museum or Museum of Cairo is living testimony of rich and unique egyptian history. It has 120,000 items and add on visit to mummies room is highly recommended. A good guide enriches your visit. Soon this museum is being shifted to a larger sprawling modern museum complex near pyramids in Giza.Today's Alexandria in EGYPT is a dusty seaside Egyptian town with an over-inflated population of 4 million. While much of the city is badly in need of a fresh coat of paint, history both ancient and modern is everywhere if you just scratch the surface. Perched on Mediterranean sea and Founded by Alexander the Great in 331 BC, Alexandria became the capital of Greco-Roman Egypt. 
One of the original seven wonders of the world The Lighthouse of Alexandria (Pharos) was built in the third century BC and it was among the highest structures in the world, second only to the Great Pyramids. But it was damaged by 2 earthquakes in 1303 and 1323.
The Library of Alexandria was the largest library of the ancient world and the place where great philosophers and scientists of that age came to seek knowledge. Like many other institutions this iconic place also underwent many planned and unplanned ravages and destructions. What stands today is Bibliotheca Alexandria,  a completely new modern structure with reminisces of its glorious past.Abu Simbel in Upper Egypt was saved from the rising waters of Lake Nasser, growing behind the Aswan Dam, in a massive archaeological rescue and relocation plan sponsored by UNESCO in the 1960s (just imagine the magnitude of this colossal exercise). The complex of temples dedicated to the Pharaoh Ramses II "the Great" remain an evocative and unforgettable destination. Abu Simbel is a village lying 280 km south of Aswan and only 40 km north of the Sudanese border.It is believed that If Abu Simbel had not been saved, places like Cambodia's Angkor Wat and other magnificent UNESCO World Heritage sites might only have lived on in history books.This incredible effort later became the catalyst for a UNESCO World Heritage list that would help protect and promote what now totals 1,073 significant cultural and natural sites around the globe.
