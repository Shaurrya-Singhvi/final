Beautiful eyes, fantastic smiles
<br>
Cute face, billion dreams
<br>
Is this not a identity of a child
<br>
Then why do I see children
<br>
Tear filled eyes,  terrified faces
<br>
Rough hands and ruin dreams
<br>
<br>
Broke in their childhood
<br>
Overloaded with work
<br>
Loaded with responsibilities 
<br>
At such a early age.
<br>
<br>
So much to learn
<br>
So much to accomplish 
<br>
But not given enough time to then
<br>
Fight for a cause
<br>
Raise your voice
<br>
Stop child labor
<br>
<br>
Put smiles back on their faces 
<br>
Give them their childhood 
<br>
what was stolen from them
<br>
Fight for a cause
<br>
Raise your voice 
<br>
STOP CHILD LABOR

Nature is all around us,
<br>
Verdant trees and bushes; magnificent rivers and seas.
<br>
We see its beauty from dawn to dusk,
<br>
The glorious sunrise, the magical twilight and the cool night breeze.
<br>
<br>
The bird are chirping,
<br>
To the tunes of nature’s melody.
<br>
The flowers are dancing,
<br>
To the songs of rhapsody.
<br>
<br>
Dogs are barking, cats are purring, 
<br>
Lions are roaring, duck are quacking
<br>
Animals call nature its abode,
<br>
Unfortunately trees getting lesser and buildings getting more, 
<br>
<br>
Nature is showering us with its blessings,
<br>
Now it is up to us to protect its wellbeing.
<br>
We should pledge to save mother nature,
<br>
For health and happiness or our future.

Wear your shoes, tie your shoelaces,
<br>
Toes behind the line, it’s time to have a race.
<br>
It’s time to have fun!!
<br>
<br>
GET SET 
<br>
JUMP, SKIP, RUN
<br>
Athletes running on the field,
<br>
Cheering from the audience is the need.
<br>
<br>
Running is fun and joyous, but Basketball is another sport which is fabulous.
<br>
RUNNING, BOUNCING and DRIBBLING…...
<br>
Yay! We see our score tripling!!!
<br>
Players scoring a basket,
<br>
The team hitting their target.
<br>
<br>
Run, jump or stand tall,
<br>
Behind all your goals,
<br>
Like you run after a ball.
<br>
Never give up, keep your spirits high,
<br>
Why just walk or run my friend, when you can soar and fly!!
