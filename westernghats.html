Dudhsagar waterfalls,a 4-tiered water fall system, along the borders of Karnataka and Goa, also known as Tambdi Surla, is amongst the tallest waterfalls in India, and monsoon brings its full glory. The beautiful 22 km trek (3 km of it is actually on railway line), crossing many streams, bridges and thick plantations through the rich and diverse flora and fauna of Bhagwan Mahaveer Wildlife sanctuary and Mollem national park along the western ghats is absolutely memorable and breathtaking. You find all the reasons to get lost in the beautiful deciduous forest and monsoon showers are icing on the cake. The sound of gushing water and the constant insect noise from the jungle makes for the amazing natural setting culminating in  this 6 hrs trek as absolutely lifetime experience.Comfortable Stay in natural surroundings of 50 acres Dudhsagar Plantations farmhouse with its natural pool and its lovely cottages made all the efforts to reach this place worth taking.Most memorable moment was when I could click my dream shot of a passing train ( Belgaum Vasco railway line) on the bridge with falls in the backdrop. Beautiful and pleasant hill station Chikmagalur in Karnataka is year round destination but at its best in monsoon. You pass through lush green Coffee plantations, sprawling coffee estates and many streams and falls. To the north is Baba Budangiri, a mountain range in the Western Ghats with 3 large holy caves and trails through forests and grasslands lead up to Mullayanagiri Peak. The cascading Hebbe Falls lie in an area of  thick coffee plantations. You also pass through Bhadra wildlife sanctuary which is home to elephants, tigers and leopards. The literal meaning of Chikmagalur is ‘Land of the younger daughter.’
Situated at the height of 3400 ft, this picturesque district, with plenty of lovely home-stays in coffee estates will never cease to impress you. Drive during peak of monsoon add a different flavour to whole experience.</p></div>
