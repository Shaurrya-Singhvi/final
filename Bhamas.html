<p> The Bahamas or The Bahama Islands, is an archipelago consisting of about 2,000 islands if you include the cays, which are small islands that are formed on coral reefs. It has simple people, pristine beaches, robust economy and hair braiding craze. Very popular destination amongst cruise liners and independent tourists as well. Personally I am not a big fan of luxury cruise holidays but Bahamas cruise from Miami on Norwegian sky changed my opinion little bit. Three days filled with best of world food, private islands, unlimited fun and lot to SEE. cruise also help u to see and immerse in lifestyle and culture of people from many many countries. However looking forward for my first expedition cruise experience soon which might have an edge above luxury cruises.The John F. Kennedy Space Center (KSC) is the NASA facility supporting Launch Complex 39 (LC-39), originally built for the Saturn V, the largest and most powerful operational launch vehicle in history, for the Apollo manned Moon landing program proposed by President John F. Kennedy. Located on Merritt Island, Florida, the center is north-northwest of Cape Canaveral on the Atlantic Ocean, midway between Miami and Jacksonville on Florida's Space Coast.Discovery cove in Orlando is considered as no. 1 theme park in world by TripAdvisor rating. It has ultimate luxury with some rare birds, Dolphins to swim with, coral reefs and sting rays to snorkel along and much more. Though seems little expensive, overall it's a wonderful experience.</p></div>
