<p>Other than Pyramids, two other attractions of Cairo deserve special mention.Khan el-Khalili  bazaar is a major souk in the historic center of Cairo. Shops typically sell souvenirs, antiques and jewellery and sky is the limit for bargaining. But strolling along the narrow lane is a real immersive experience. In addition to shops, there are several coffeehouses ( serving arabic coffee and offering Sheesha), restaurants, and street food vendors distributed throughout the market. This particular joint offered us really good local vegetarian stuff. The al-Hussein Mosque is adjacent to Khan el-Khalili, and Al-Azhar University and its mosque are nearby.
The Museum of Egyptian Antiquities, known commonly as the Egyptian Museum or Museum of Cairo is living testimony of rich and unique egyptian history. It has 120,000 items and add on visit to mummies room is highly recommended. A good guide enriches your visit. Soon this museum is being shifted to a larger sprawling modern museum complex near pyramids in Giza.Today's Alexandria in EGYPT is a dusty seaside Egyptian town with an over-inflated population of 4 million. While much of the city is badly in need of a fresh coat of paint, history both ancient and modern is everywhere if you just scratch the surface. Perched on Mediterranean sea and Founded by Alexander the Great in 331 BC, Alexandria became the capital of Greco-Roman Egypt. 
One of the original seven wonders of the world The Lighthouse of Alexandria (Pharos) was built in the third century BC and it was among the highest structures in the world, second only to the Great Pyramids. But it was damaged by 2 earthquakes in 1303 and 1323.
The Library of Alexandria was the largest library of the ancient world and the place where great philosophers and scientists of that age came to seek knowledge. Like many other institutions this iconic place also underwent many planned and unplanned ravages and destructions. What stands today is Bibliotheca Alexandria,  a completely new modern structure with reminisces of its glorious past.Abu Simbel in Upper Egypt was saved from the rising waters of Lake Nasser, growing behind the Aswan Dam, in a massive archaeological rescue and relocation plan sponsored by UNESCO in the 1960s (just imagine the magnitude of this colossal exercise). The complex of temples dedicated to the Pharaoh Ramses II "the Great" remain an evocative and unforgettable destination. Abu Simbel is a village lying 280 km south of Aswan and only 40 km north of the Sudanese border.It is believed that If Abu Simbel had not been saved, places like Cambodia's Angkor Wat and other magnificent UNESCO World Heritage sites might only have lived on in history books.This incredible effort later became the catalyst for a UNESCO World Heritage list that would help protect and promote what now totals 1,073 significant cultural and natural sites around the globe.

Dudhsagar waterfalls,a 4-tiered water fall system, along the borders of Karnataka and Goa, also known as Tambdi Surla, is amongst the tallest waterfalls in India, and monsoon brings its full glory. The beautiful 22 km trek (3 km of it is actually on railway line), crossing many streams, bridges and thick plantations through the rich and diverse flora and fauna of Bhagwan Mahaveer Wildlife sanctuary and Mollem national park along the western ghats is absolutely memorable and breathtaking. You find all the reasons to get lost in the beautiful deciduous forest and monsoon showers are icing on the cake. The sound of gushing water and the constant insect noise from the jungle makes for the amazing natural setting culminating in  this 6 hrs trek as absolutely lifetime experience.Comfortable Stay in natural surroundings of 50 acres Dudhsagar Plantations farmhouse with its natural pool and its lovely cottages made all the efforts to reach this place worth taking.Most memorable moment was when I could click my dream shot of a passing train ( Belgaum Vasco railway line) on the bridge with falls in the backdrop. Beautiful and pleasant hill station Chikmagalur in Karnataka is year round destination but at its best in monsoon. You pass through lush green Coffee plantations, sprawling coffee estates and many streams and falls. To the north is Baba Budangiri, a mountain range in the Western Ghats with 3 large holy caves and trails through forests and grasslands lead up to Mullayanagiri Peak. The cascading Hebbe Falls lie in an area of  thick coffee plantations. You also pass through Bhadra wildlife sanctuary which is home to elephants, tigers and leopards. The literal meaning of Chikmagalur is ‘Land of the younger daughter.’
Situated at the height of 3400 ft, this picturesque district, with plenty of lovely home-stays in coffee estates will never cease to impress you. Drive during peak of monsoon add a different flavour to whole experience.</p></div>

<p> The Bahamas or The Bahama Islands, is an archipelago consisting of about 2,000 islands if you include the cays, which are small islands that are formed on coral reefs. It has simple people, pristine beaches, robust economy and hair braiding craze. Very popular destination amongst cruise liners and independent tourists as well. Personally I am not a big fan of luxury cruise holidays but Bahamas cruise from Miami on Norwegian sky changed my opinion little bit. Three days filled with best of world food, private islands, unlimited fun and lot to SEE. cruise also help u to see and immerse in lifestyle and culture of people from many many countries. However looking forward for my first expedition cruise experience soon which might have an edge above luxury cruises.The John F. Kennedy Space Center (KSC) is the NASA facility supporting Launch Complex 39 (LC-39), originally built for the Saturn V, the largest and most powerful operational launch vehicle in history, for the Apollo manned Moon landing program proposed by President John F. Kennedy. Located on Merritt Island, Florida, the center is north-northwest of Cape Canaveral on the Atlantic Ocean, midway between Miami and Jacksonville on Florida's Space Coast.Discovery cove in Orlando is considered as no. 1 theme park in world by TripAdvisor rating. It has ultimate luxury with some rare birds, Dolphins to swim with, coral reefs and sting rays to snorkel along and much more. Though seems little expensive, overall it's a wonderful experience.</p></div>
