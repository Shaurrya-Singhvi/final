<p>Beautiful eyes, fantastic smiles
<br>
Cute face, billion dreams
<br>
Is this not a identity of a child
<br>
Then why do I see children
<br>
Tear filled eyes,  terrified faces
<br>
Rough hands and ruin dreams
<br>
Broke in their childhood
<br>
Overloaded with work
<br>
Loaded with responsibilities 
<br>
At such a early age.
<br>
So much to learn
<br>
So much to accomplish 
<br>
But not given enough time to then
<br>
Fight for a cause
<br>
Raise your voice
<br>
Stop child labor
<br>
Put smiles back on their faces 
<br>
Give them their childhood 
<br>
what was stolen from them
<br>
Fight for a cause
<br>
Raise your voice 
<br>
STOP CHILD LABOR</p></div>
